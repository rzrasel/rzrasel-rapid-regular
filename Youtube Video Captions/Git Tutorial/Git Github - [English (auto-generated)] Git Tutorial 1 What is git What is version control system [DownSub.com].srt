00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,879
hello friends welcome to code basics

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,440
coding tutorial in this tutorial we are

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,600
going to see what is git

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,519
when you ask this question to anyone the

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,599
usual answer you get is

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,639
git is a version control system

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,599
but hey

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
what is version control system

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
let's look at the problems that we

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
encounter when you don't use version

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,519
control system so let's say you have a

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,439
computer and you are writing code on

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,160
that computer so the code files are

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,200
saved locally on that computer's hard

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,480
disk

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
but what if your hard disk crashes or

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
your computer has

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
some kind of problem

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
in that case whatever code you have

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,440
written is lost

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,840
second problem is if multiple people

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
want to contribute to

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,879
that code then they cannot do it if it

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
is on one computer even if it is let's

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,199
say these two people have

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
their own computers and if they want to

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
work on the same code how do they do

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,479
that

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,280
they have to transfer files using a pen

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
drive from one computer to another and

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,479
they have to do code merge manually

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
which is quite cumbersome

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
third problem you have is there is no

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,720
tracking of versions so let's say you

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
have your code it is working fine and

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,880
you are

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,960
making one more enhancements or you are

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
fixing some bugs so you made some

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
changes and let's say it doesn't look

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
good so you want to go to previous good

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
version of your code

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,640
but

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,600
there is no way if you have your code on

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
your computer because the simple file

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,399
system doesn't give you

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
a version tracking

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
so you have all these different issues

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
especially when you're working on a

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
bigger code base or a sample project you

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,159
will encounter these issues again and

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
again

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
version control system solves all these

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
problems

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,960
let's look at all these problems one by

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
one and see how

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,758
vcs or version control system solves

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,959
these issues

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
so our first problem was hard disk

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
failure

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
inversion control system

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
the code is saved on cloud cloud is

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
basically some remote machine which is

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
much more stable than your local

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
computer

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,319
and it is guaranteed that you will never

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,720
lose your code from cloud

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,280
so you store your code on the cloud and

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,519
then you sync the files to your local

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,560
computer

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
that way if you have hardware problem or

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
some computer breakdown you can always

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
get your code back from the cloud

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
so problem number one fixed

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
problem number two

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,519
multiple people contributing to the same

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,879
code base

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,000 Label - 77 - 02:52 ------------------------|
again

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,720
you have your golden copy of your code

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
on the cloud so that

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
these two people can work on their

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,280
individual

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
computers

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
and then whenever they're ready

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,440
uh to push their changes they will push

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
it to a cloud

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640 Label - 86 - 03:10 ------------------------|
now let's say if they're working on a

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
same function let's say here there is a

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,519
function

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
python function def sum and if they're

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
they both are making uh changes to the

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480 Label - 91 - 03:20 ------------------------|
same function then there are merge tools

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,879
available which can help you resolve the

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
conflict so merging is pretty easy these

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,799 Label - 94 - 03:28 ------------------------|
two people can work on their own

95
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,280
without worrying about anything

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,159 Label - 96 - 03:33 ------------------------|
so it's it's very beautiful

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
how uh vcs solves these issues or of

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
collaboration

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959 Label - 99 - 03:42 ------------------------|
problem number theo three was uh version

100
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
tracking

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,560 Label - 101 - 03:47 ------------------------|
in version control system uh you have

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
all of your

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,560
changes tracked down through different

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400 Label - 104 - 03:56 ------------------------|
versions of the same file so let's say

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
you have this file called foo dot py

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
which has some

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,120 Label - 107 - 04:03 ------------------------|Starting
uh a function called sum

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
and let's say right now the function

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
looks like this it just returns a plus b

110
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000 Label - 110 - 04:07 ------------------------|
but if you make some changes later on

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239 Label - 111 - 04:10 ------------------------|
and if you save it it will be saved as

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
version number two i was number three

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600 Label - 113 - 04:14 ------------------------|
and so on so at any given point of time

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
you feel like i i want to go back to the

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
previous old version which was working

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,320
okay you can do it very easily

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040 Label - 117 - 04:26 ------------------------|
now there are different

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
version control systems available in the

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,919
market

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,440 Label - 120 - 04:31 ------------------------|
for example git

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
mercurial subversion etc

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639 Label - 122 - 04:37 ------------------------|
but git is by far the best version

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
control system

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
i will tell you two reasons

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
number one is it is a distributed

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
version control system

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,199
where

128
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
the version history is maintained on

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
your local computer

130
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,680
as well as it is maintained on the cloud

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479 Label - 131 - 04:55 ------------------------|
so let's say you are

132
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,160
in some area where you don't have

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
internet internet connection

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
you still have an ability to try

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
to track the versions

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680 Label - 136 - 05:07 ------------------------|
uh and whenever you have intercon

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
internet connection you can sync it up

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
with your uh remote which is your

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
copy in the cloud

140
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960 Label - 140 - 05:17 ------------------------|
the second biggest benefit of using it

141
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,919
is

142
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,120
github

143
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
the most popular website to host code is

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
powered by get

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
that was all about

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,840
git

147
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,639
thank you for watching
