00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,370 Label - 1 - 00:00 ------------------------|Starting
welcome to core basics coding tutorial

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,140
and this episode we are going to see

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,620
what is github and why is it so popular

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,030
github is a website that allows you to

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,019
store your code onto the cloud now don't

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,870
think of github as just a cloud storage

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,140 Label - 7 - 00:15 ------------------------|
it is a full-fledged version control

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,500
system power bi get so without

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,650
discussing it any further let's look at

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,359
the demo so first we'll go to this

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,840
website github calm here if you want to

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,489
upload your code or if you want to

13
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,950
contribute to someone else code you need

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,340 Label - 14 - 00:37 ------------------------|
to create your login so creating login

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,350
is pretty straightforward you give it

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,440
your email ID and password and you can

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,530
sign up for github I am already signed

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,469
up that's why I will just use sign-in

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,670
button and log into my account ok so I

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,890
had this account and I have this

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,699 Label - 21 - 00:58 ------------------------|
repository called py where I store all

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,439
of my Python code so you see like I have

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,110 Label - 23 - 01:07 ------------------------|
all these Python files and my readme

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,530
file which is here and bunch of

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,040
directories and here what I have is all

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,759 Label - 26 - 01:17 ------------------------|
my commit history so whatever code I

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,740
have committed all the versions and

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,630
everything is stored so if you want one

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,939 Label - 29 - 01:24 ------------------------|
if I want to go back to any of the

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,340
previous commit I can easily go and

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,650
check what happened during that coming

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,520
ok now I have the same codebase

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
synced up on to my local computer here

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,909
in this directory so this is py charm

35
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,070
Python code editor and as you can see

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,850
here I have same list of files and

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,979
directories for example I have debugging

38
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,619
modules multiprocessing

39
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,420
so it's basically all these files I have

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,399
them stored on this github cloud storage

41
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,110 Label - 41 - 02:01 ------------------------|
cloud storage is basically something

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,950
like Gmail so Gmail you can access it

43
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,560
from anywhere because it is not stored

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,410
locally on your device computer or it

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,330 Label - 45 - 02:13 ------------------------|
could be a cell phone it is stored

46
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,130
somewhere else so you can access it

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,209
anytime similarly github is a cloud

48
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,550
where my code is stored so if I want to

49
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,200
log in from some other computer and make

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,190
my code changes I can always do it okay

51
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,670 Label - 51 - 02:28 ------------------------|
now it is powered by a good version

52
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,280
control system if you already don't know

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,170
what is version control system I would

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,620
suggest that you go and watch my video

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,360
on the version control system okay so

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760 Label - 56 - 02:45 ------------------------|
now I will show you how to make code

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
change and push it to our github

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,489
repository repository is basically this

59
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,410
particular area it's like a directory

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,599
with all the files and subdirectory into

61
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,150
it so that's what I call a repository or

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,959
a repo repo is a short form so learn P

63
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,090
is my login name and py is my repository

64
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,250
okay so I have this particular code

65
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,290
which is not functioning the way it

66
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,680
should so I am making some code changes

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,350
here okay and I made my code changes

68
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,890
higher on the program I make sure it

69
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,650
works fine yes it is working fine so now

70
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,769
I am ready to push my changes to get now

71
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,780
before I make this changes let me show

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,799
you what - dot py has on github so on

73
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,139
github as you see I added these two

74
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,590
lines ok but in github it is still my

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,220
old code ok so I just got that code I

76
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,470
added these two lines to fix some issue

77
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,590
and now I am going to push my changes to

78
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,139
github so I will say right-click git

79
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,209
commit directory whatever changes I have

80
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,430
I just want to commit it so I will save

81
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,670
fixed a bug in taste dot py and I will

82
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,579
say gump commit and push so what this

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,269
will do is this will push my changes to

84
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,810
upstream to here ok

85
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,060
and now if I look at my commit log here

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,150
you see fix a bug in test or py whatever

87
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,430
I committed 11 seconds ago it is visible

88
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,010
here and if I click here on this commit

89
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,350
ID it will show me the difference you

90
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,900
see these two lines are highlighted I it

91
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,590
says that I added these two lines ok so

92
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,710
now my code is pushed and if I look at

93
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,550
this dot py file I have those two lines

94
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,870
added here so this is a quick demo of

95
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,960
how you push your changes to your github

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,700
okay let me now cover some of the

97
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,270
interesting features of github the most

98
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,160
important feature of github is a pull

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,060
request

100
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
what pull request does is it allows you

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,330
to collaborate with other projects in

102
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,750
this diagram there is this github repo

103
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,540
let's say this is some inventory

104
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,180
management system right so this is the

105
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,860
code for inventory management system it

106
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,530
has bench of files and restore on github

107
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,510
repo that's why I have shown it in the

108
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,300
cloud and these people are kind of the

109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,760
owner of tag repo these are the people

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,090
who write or who wrote that code ok now

111
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,330
let's see this person acts he wants to

112
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,510
make Jeanne in into this code for that

113
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,419
he will just simply fork the code fork

114
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,970
means just simply copying the code to

115
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,669
his own private space so again this is

116
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,710
in the cloud which is which means it is

117
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,039
on github but it is a private repository

118
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,530
which means it is this person's private

119
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,889
space and he will sync up the code to

120
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,510
his local computer he will make changes

121
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,360
for example in this function this blue

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,729
line is the chain that this guy made and

123
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,580
he will push it to his own cloud after

124
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,260
that once he is done making his changes

125
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,660
and he tested his code and he's good to

126
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:21,990
go

127
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,979
he will sand or request to these people

128
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,570
asking to pull his changes into the main

129
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,390
repository so he will say ok hey guys

130
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm done with my change can you please

131
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,020
pull my change

132
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,370
into your repository and these people

133
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,230
using our code review they will

134
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,480
basically pull the question as a code

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,250
review so they will do a code review and

136
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,060
if it if it looks good to them then they

137
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,520
will accept the pull request so that's

138
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,550
how the code will get merged here now

139
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,270
pull requests is becoming a central

140
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,290
theme in open source world so an open

141
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,420
source project anyone can contribute to

142
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,680
the open source code so most of the open

143
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,260
source projects are nowadays on github

144
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,320
and the people who contribute to these

145
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,770
projects using a poll request are that's

146
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,620
why a github github is becoming very

147
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,080
popular because it has such a good

148
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,080
support for collaboration and open

149
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,740
source projects okay there are some

150
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,650
other useful features of github status

151
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,380
issues issue tracking you know if you

152
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,970
have a code base it will allow you to

153
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,270
track issues or Viki which means it will

154
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,460
allow you to write documentation on your

155
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,860
code pulse which will give you different

156
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,930
pulse and graph both will give you a

157
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,120
different statistics and I will quickly

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,210
show all these four features to you so I

159
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,710
have this sample code repository which I

160
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,110
found it through Google and on this repo

161
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,020
has this issue list so if you click here

162
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,810
so here you see your main code and then

163
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,210
here you see all the issues so people

164
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,760
will report all these issues here you

165
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,500
can go to issue you can have a

166
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,570
screenshot attached you can give a

167
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,690
description reproduction condition and

168
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,440
so on and then there there is a pull

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,480
request feature which I just talked

170
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,460
about by showing that diagram then there

171
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,440
is a wiki so wiki is short of like a

172
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,870
documentation so for my code base

173
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,230
for this html5 boilerplate code base the

174
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,510
owner of this repository has put all

175
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,570
this nice documentation so you can click

176
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:49,900
through

177
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,470
wait you can read through all the

178
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,580
documentation you can go to different

179
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,290
website etcetera ah there is a pulse and

180
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,360
graph feature which just shows you the

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,850
pulse on your project so basically

182
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,490
ongoing activity on your project so here

183
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,790
on this project I have some 0 mod

184
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,970
politicus 1 open pull request and so on

185
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,150
and one issue so it is sort of like your

186
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,580
dashboard and then there are graphs

187
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,400
which will show you different statistic

188
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,230
graph like contributors so these are the

189
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,360
people who are contributing activity to

190
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,550
this cool repo there are comments so on

191
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,710
this day there were nine commits so

192
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,480
there was highest amount of activity on

193
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,380
this particular day ah there is core

194
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,770
frequency Network member and so on so it

195
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,620
has all this nice useful feature but the

196
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,690
most important thing about github is

197
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,100
this whole website itself it's a nice

198
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,710
GUI graphical user interface that allows

199
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,590
you to see your core and of various

200
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,890
dimensions of various statistics on your

201
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,690
code ok so these were basically the four

202
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,470
other features that that were that there

203
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,920
are important features for using github

204
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,430
now there are some interesting facts

205
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,300
about github it is very popular nowadays

206
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,260
or there are 14 million users with 35

207
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,790
million code repositories some of the

208
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,340
popular open source projects such as

209
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,850
Linux kernel has been posted on github

210
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,550
so if you go to this link github.com

211
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,160
tour was less Linux you will see the

212
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,090
code for Linux there I would say let's

213
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,870
try this so let's go to github.com

214
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:55,240
tour was Linux and I'm having some

215
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,430
internet issue but it's eye graphics ok

216
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,819
so this is the code base for Linux so

217
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,040
you can actually see the Linux kernel

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,639
core base here and if you feel like you

219
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,649
want to contribute to this project then

220
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,930
you can click on this button and form

221
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,809
the repository and basically follow this

222
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,389
diagram to make code changes and when

223
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,569
you send back the pull request the owner

224
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:25,449
of that repository will give you your

225
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,790
code changes and it will possibly be

226
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,870
merged if things look ok so see it's so

227
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,970
powerful there is a Linux kernel and you

228
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,699
can now contribute to Linux kernel just

229
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,839
because of github ok so that is all

230
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,040
